# Power-BI--Human-Resource-Training-Development-cost-analysis
This project presents a Human Resource Training and Development Cost Analysis Report developed using Power BI. The report provides a comprehensive visualization and analysis of training and development expenses within an organization, helping decision-makers optimize resource allocation and measure the effectiveness of their training programs.
This Power BI project analyzes HR training and development costs with interactive dashboards. The data was cleaned for consistency, modeled into relational tables, and enhanced with custom DAX measures for key insights like total costs, training results, and cost trends. Visualizations include department-wise breakdowns, training type analysis, and expense trends. The report helps organizations optimize training budgets and make data-driven decisions.
